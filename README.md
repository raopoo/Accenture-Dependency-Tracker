The _Nology program gave me the opportunity to attend a 4 day bootcamp with Accenture. We were a group of 5 members in a team and had to solve an existing problem for Accenture.
Problem description :- 
I am a product developer working to maintain a product on the Splunk platform. This means I need to make sure that if the platform is updated, I know where to change the code and what documentation is affected to ensure the product remains compliant with compatibility and security requirements. Is there a quick way to check if any of my code or documentation relies on third party libraries which have been updated since the last product release? 

Solution Provided:- 
The Dependency tracker finds all the latest updates on the Splunk website and provides a consolidated data with the links to all the versions
